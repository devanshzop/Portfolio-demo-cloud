# Portfolio Template

A personal portfolio template built with **React**, **Vite**, and **TypeScript**. This template is designed to help you quickly create and customize your portfolio with ease.

## Features

- **Vite** for fast builds and optimized performance.
- **React** for building interactive UI components.
- **TypeScript** for type safety and better development experience.
- Easy customization via configuration in `src/config/portfolio.ts`.
- Responsive layout for both mobile and desktop views.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the project, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (version 14 or later)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) (for package management)

## Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to set up the portfolio template:

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine using Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/naveen-bandela-au2/portfolio-template.git
cd portfolio-template
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Use npm or yarn to install all the project dependencies:

**Using npm:**

### 3. Configure Portfolio Settings

All the configuration for the portfolio template can be found in `src/config/portfolio.ts`. You can customize the following settings:

};
```

### 4. Start the Development Server

Run the following command to start the development server and preview the portfolio:

**Using npm:**

```bash
npm run dev
```

**Using yarn:**

```bash
yarn dev
```

The development server will start, and your portfolio will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Build and Deploy

To build the portfolio for production:

**Using npm:**

```bash
npm run build
```

**Using yarn:**

```bash
yarn build
```

The build files will be created in the `dist/` directory. You can then deploy these files to your preferred hosting provider (e.g., GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel).

## Folder Structure

Here’s an overview of the folder structure:

```
portfolio-template/
├── public/              # Static assets like images, fonts, etc.
├── src/                 # Source code
│   ├── components/      # Reusable React components
│   ├── config/          # Portfolio configuration (src/config/portfolio.ts)
│   ├── pages/           # Main portfolio page
│   ├── styles/          # Global styles and theming
│   └── App.tsx          # Main React app entry point
├── dist/                # Production build output (generated after build)
├── package.json         # Project metadata and dependencies
└── tsconfig.json        # TypeScript configuration
```

## Customization

- You can easily change the theme colors, fonts, and layout in the `src/styles` directory.
- The projects section in the configuration file is dynamic, so you can add or remove projects by modifying the `projects` array in `src/config/portfolio.ts`.
